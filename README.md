Machine Learning (ML), especially Deep Learning (DL), has become a new darling of technological companies. Indeed, ML has replaced traditional algorithms in performing many tasks, the most commonly known includes content recommendation, facial recognition, fraud detection and etc. The rise in popularity of ML/DL is accompanied by growth in computing power of chips developed in recent years as well as the availability of large scale datasets that are necessary for “learning”. ML algorithms have been widely deployed in the industry with the help of a variety of toolkits developed by industry leaders as well as researchers in academia.
Similar to the adoption of any significant technology in history, ML is on its way to become more beginner-friendly. In companies that now heavily rely on ML in their production environments, dummy-proof and streamlined procedures for taking raw data to actionable insights or revenue-generating functionalities were long developed and continuously optimized to ensure efficiency and reliability.
